    # You can add here annotations to configure how the Service exposes the Gateway pods.
    # This is useful to configure how the cloud provider exposes the Gateway to the internet.
    # See the cloud provider's documentation to discover available options.
    #
    # Example: this annotation configures the AWS cloud load balancer to enable proxy-protocol (highly recommentded
    # for source IP detection)
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol: "*"

    # You can apply Istio Mesh configuration options on a per Gateway basis using the "proxy.istio.io/config"
    # annotation. See https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#ProxyConfig for available options.
    #
    # Example: this will enable proxy protocol in the gateway listeners as well as configure the gateway as the internet
    # facing one (first trusted proxy in the request path), which is important for source IP detection
    # (https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-x-forwarded-for).
